# ColbyWiki

Fun little project. I've always wanted to make a Wiki.

## Goal
__Small, easily customizable (for developers).__

All components are passed directly into the Container, which makes customization extremely easy.

The PHP library Parsedown is used for formatting. Wiki links are as simple as using double brackets.

Currently working on extending Parsedown to work with Bulma.
